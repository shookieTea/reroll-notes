## Learning

This site is meant to collect information that's immediately relevant to people who want to start learning the KD speedrun.

### Important general information

- Any% timing ends on the first frame you reach 300m, which can make it difficult to accurately stop the timer at the end of a run. It's recommended to use the autosplitter to handle this.

- Use the second right trigger (R2 on PS2/PS3, RT on 360, ZR on Switch) on the overworld to fly to Earth between levels.

- Skip king text during levels with Start instead of X or A.

- Turn off VSync, which introduces noticeable input lag and makes the game much harder to speedrun. To turn it off, interact with the bird on the overworld -> "Display Settings" hotkey on the bottom of the screen -> V Sync off.

**Note:** Some players with 144 Hz monitors have found no input lag with VSync on. If you have a 144 Hz monitor then it's worth at least trying how it feels with it on, because it prevents the prompt glitch mentioned above.

- At the start of a run (with VSync off), the button prompt that begins the tutorial is bugged and only accepts input about 5-10% of the time. You can maximize your chances of getting past the prompt by mashing both the "start" and "text advance" buttons, as long as you're pressing them at different times. (This is the only bugged prompt in the game; for all others you only need one button.) If you're on PC, it's easy to hold A on controller and mash Tab (start) on keyboard.

**Note:** Higher game FPS makes the prompt harder to advance, and the framerate is uncapped. If you're having a hard time advancing the prompt, cap your game FPS to 300.

- We recommend using our practice mod when learning and practicing individual levels (ILs). The mod can't be used for full game runs, but it cuts out a lot of overworld movement when practicing, especially for the shorter levels. The documentation and download link for the practice mod launcher is in [resources](./resources.md).

- The RTA mod is also recommended for full-game runs for the built-in A button turbo. It also offers several other quality of life improvements that don't materially affect the speedrun.

- The bot messages in stream-announcements automatically notify when someone on our list of runners goes live with a Katamari game. All runners are welcome to be added - just ask!

### Getting ready for your first run

Currently, the easiest first step towards learning the game would probably be to play along with this no boost run with live commentary found here: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/539063804

Your goal for each level should be to be able to play through it from memory a couple of times in a row without getting lost or stuck.

It's probably easiest to learn one level at a time, but mixing up which level you play might be a good idea while you're still trying to memorize the basic routes, to reinforce the levels you haven't played for a while.

For each level, you could try:

- playing along with the video in real time, pausing it when you fall behind.
- watching a chunk of the video that you can remember, pausing it, then playing that part yourself from memory until you catch up to where you paused the video.
- The practice mod currently supports (sort of stable) savestates, which can be helpful to quickly learn the later parts of longer levels. Refer to the practice mod documentation in [resources](./resources.md) for how to use the savestates.

Once you have a good idea of the overall route for each level (or before, since RTA is fun), jump in and get a few PBs under your belt! Feel free to post your times in personal-bests.

After you're comfortable with the route, here's a few things you can try to start optimizing your times further.

- Use other people's PBs on speedrun.com to get a better idea of up-to-date routes that people use in their runs. **The improvement that comes with actively watching other people play and analyzing their decisions can't be overstated.**

- Practicing the longer levels (8, 9, moon) is usually more effective for improving your full game PB compared to the shorter levels.

- If you want to transition from no boost to using boosts, start including easy-looking boosts into your route to get more comfortable with the boost input (mostly when there's not a lot to pick up and you can afford to be a little inaccurate). Boosting is very difficult and it's probably going to suck for a while, but failing a lot is the only way to improve. Every time you do it you're getting a little bit better.

- Use the size bottleneck list in the individualk level pages or the spreadsheet in [resources](./resources.md) to help diagnose when you're unexpectedly too small to roll something up. **A big part of optimizing your play is anticipating these bottleneck sizes and making sure you won't be too small for anything coming up.**

- If you feel like you're hitting a wall and can't improve, try a different category or even just take a break for a while. Remember the golden rules of Katamari speedruns: have fun and be yourself!
