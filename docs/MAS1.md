## Notes

### Optimization Strategies for 14 Second Times (enzor)

- bouncing off the chocolate box and grabbing the caramel when leaving is the fastest way to get 5.8 on table
- Releasing your sticks after boosting slows down your katamari and helps you control the movement on the first boost
- Hitting the slope on the table generates more speed
  this angle allows you to set up to quickly turn after grabbing the biscuit stack

- pumping the left stick to turn quickly while holding the right stick forward can set you up for a fast sunkir route
- and avoids bouncing away
- The turn still works for the wall route

if you're 9.1 before the first double cookie you can end on a caramel instead of the last eyedrops:

## Routes

### Sunkir Route

Warning: This Route is challenging and will take hours to get consistent.
Making sure your at the right angle before trying the sunkir boost is very important, don't rush it when your learning or in RTA. It's worth taking the extra 0.3-0.5 seconds to fix your angle rather than missing objects and being forced to do a backup strat to make up size.
Sunkir route is incredibly tight in size, here grass misses only 1 cookie and is exact size to finish

- (missing image) grab this line of candy and try to reboost after the eyedrop
- boosting later will make the book less consistent to move through
- you can maintain your speed from the boost after the eyedrops to the end
- If you miss a cherry or compass you need to grab the extra lipstick for size
