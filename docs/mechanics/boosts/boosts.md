### Gachas

A **gacha** is what we call an input where one stick is up and the other is down. A **left gacha** turns left (left stick down, right stick up) and a **right gacha** turns right (left stick up, right stick down). Whether a stick is "up" or "down" depends only on its height, as shown below. 

Specifically, with analog input scaled between -1 and 1, a y-coordinate above 0.25 is an "up" input and below -0.25 is a "down" input.

A gacha occurs on the *first frame* when *both sticks* are in a gacha zone: if one stick is already up, a gacha occurs the first frame the other stick is down.

Since you need to input multiple gachas in a row to spin and boost, the game maintains a *gacha count* to remember how many gachas you have done recently. It also maintains the *last gacha direction* so that it can make sure each gacha in the count is alternating: if your last gacha was left, the count will only increase when you do a right gacha.

Whenever you input a gacha, the *gacha timer* starts counting down. If you don't input a gacha of the opposite direction within 12 frames (0.4 seconds), the gacha count resets to 0.

Note: the name gacha comes from the Reroll source code itself. Martini pointed out itâ€™s a Japanese onomatopoeic word that probably refers to the clacking sound the sticks make as you boost. 

### Boosting

A **boost** occurs when you reach a specific gacha count, which changes with the katamari's size:

|  **Katamari size**  | **Gachas for a boost** |
|:-------------------:|:-------------------:|
|      Below 50cm     |          5          |
| Between 50cm and 5m |          6          |
| Between 5m and 10m  |          7          |
|      Above 10m      |          8          |

Your gacha count will continue increasing after you boost.

The gacha timer also continues running after a boost, and when the timer hits 0 it resets your gacha count as usual.

### Spinning

A **spin** occurs when your gacha count is 3. The spin will continue until either:

- the gacha timer hits 0 and your gacha count resets to 0, or
- your gacha count becomes high enough that you boost instead.

### Boost Energy and Huffing

**Boost energy** is an invisible resource that decreases while you spin and boost. More accurately, boost energy decreases by 1 on every frame your gacha count is at least 3. 
After boosting, you will continue losing boost energy until your gacha count resets.

If you don't use any boost energy for 100 frames (~3.33 seconds), you **recharge** 18 energy.

You start with 240 boost energy (the maximum value) and huff when you reach 0. When your boost energy reaches 0, a huff begins. A huff lasts for 240 frames (8 seconds). During the huff, all gacha inputs are ignored. When the huff ends, your boost energy is reset to 240.

### Resetting Gacha Count for Efficient Boosts

After boosting, your boost energy stops decreasing (and starts recharging) once your gacha count resets. Therefore, manipulating a gacha count reset as soon as possible after boosting will save boost energy.

The easiest way to reset gacha count is to let the gacha timer hit 0 (by not doing a new gacha for 0.4 seconds), but resetting the timer without losing a lot of speed can be tricky. Depending on the line you want to take, you can either briefly stop snaking or pinch for that time.

The gacha count also resets when you:

- become airborne, or
- collide with anything you can't pick up.

These mechanics can be exploited during specific boosts to minimize energy loss.
